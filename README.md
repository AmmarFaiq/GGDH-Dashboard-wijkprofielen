This is one of the ongoing dashboard projects for GGDH-ELAN from the Department of Public Health and Primary Care at LUMC / Health Campus the Hague. In the current version, there are a few notes that we need to be aware of :

1. Area coverage (will increase in the future):

- ''s-Gravenhage
- Leidschendam-Voorburg
- Rijswijk
- Wassenaar
- Hadoks Area (all of the above Gementee)
 
2. Working pages are :

- Neighbourhood: contain infographics of current and past variables per Neighbourhood.
- Supply and Demand: contains clustering and projection of selected variables per Neighbourhood in Collaboration with Hadoks

3. Multiple pages still "work-in-progress" (Diabetes, Palliative care and Pedriatic care)
4. Language options are still a work in progress
5. Utility pages still work in progress (About Us, Variables Explanation, Data Availability, Changelog)
